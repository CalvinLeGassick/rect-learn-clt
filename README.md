# rect-learn-clt
Interactive theoretical and experimental exploration of learning axis aligned rectangles under the PAC learning model.

TODO
- Sliders for adjusting sample size
- Choose multiple distributions
- Continue with classic proof for "tightest-rectangle" hypothesis
    - Include visualizations for weight of error under distribution
    - Include sliders for \epsilon and radio buttons for Distribution to see how it effects visuals and experimental computations.
